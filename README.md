# LudumDare37Source
this is the source code for my LudumDare 37 Entry

You wake up in a room and find out that you have been locked up. You find a scroll on the table in front of you. Follow half of the instructions on the scroll and get out of the room. But be quick because you only have 2 minutes(100 seconds)

##Tools used:

Paint.net
Blender
Unity 5.4
MonoDevelop



##controls:

* switch between gun and hand [Q]
* Interact with the world [E]
* move around the room [WASD]
* get your cursor back [CTRL]


##What I want to do post-mortem (on github):

I want to finish makingthis a complete game, in the next few weeks after the jam. So peeople can get an idea of how it really should have been.


##Review:
I wish it would have been just a little more polished.Also would have like to implement sound but didn't get to that. Aside from all that I like this entry 'cause this game has the best grahpics i've done so far. (thpugh its a little drak in the room)
The Game is playable but I would have liked to do more with it and will certainly give it another shot sometime in the future.
